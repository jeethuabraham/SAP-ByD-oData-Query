# SAP-ByD-oData-Query
How do i know what is the oData link? That is, my link is this -- https://my304901-sso.sapbydesign.com/sap/ap/ui/repository/SAP_UI/HTMLOBERON5/client.html?client_type=html&amp;app.component=/SAP_UI_CT/Main/root.uiccwoc&amp;rootWindow=X&amp;redirectUrl=/sap/byd/runtime#
My intention is simple. I work for a reputed firm in the industry. But, i'm facing a new challenge to which i'm new. However i'm confident i can overcome the problem with a consise solution. I've never known we can drive in data by oData in Excel through connection. The complication is, i went to the technical ID of the report in SAP. But just by having the technical ID, how do i get the correct oData link as is told in the manual? 
i would need to bring down the data to excel via these connections of oData. Then, this data needs to be refreshed at a specific time interval. Secondly, a pivot table generated from this file should be copied and pasted into outlook body and sent to a set of recepients. 
If someone could help me, it would be of great help.
